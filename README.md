## Introduction
### What is Reddit?
Reddit is a social networking site (SNS) that is somewhat different from more popular SNS such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. On Reddit, users (known as redditors) enter into smaller communities (known as subreddits) onto which submissions (or posts) are made, which include pictures, text posts (much like a common forum), links to other websites (such as YouTube, news outlets etc.), or videos. 

The subreddits are formed based on a specific theme. This theme can be as generic as r/worldnews, which is a subreddit about news around the world; r/pics which is a subreddit where users simply submit whatever pictures they'd like; the theme of a subreddit can be geographical (e.g. r/Italy, r/Boston), around hobbies (e.g. r/gaming, r/leagueoflegends), even meta-ironic commentary of redditors' behaviors (e.g. r/gamingcirclejerk). Simply, a Reddit is a host of vast subreddits, which can be just about anything.
